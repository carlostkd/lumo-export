## 🎯 About

**Lumo Chat Export** is a Firefox extension that fills a critical gap in Proton's Lumo interface  the ability to export conversation history. Since Proton doesn't offer a native export feature yet, this extension provides a secure, privacy-focused solution that lets you save your entire chat history in multiple formats.

Then you can Import the chats into Projects.

Or Download in html format for embeded into webpages.

All processing happens **locally in your browser**. Your data never leaves your device.

## ❓ Privacy FAQ

**Is it safe to set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`?**

For personal development use, yes  as long as you only install extensions you trust. This setting bypasses Mozilla's signature verification, so avoid installing random `.xpi` files from untrusted sources. For maximum safety, use a separate Firefox profile for development.
